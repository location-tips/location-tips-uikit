# Definition

MIcon is a component that allows you to use icons from the Mobiquity Icons library.

## Usage

Icon inherits all the properties of a SVG and can be used in the same way.

You need to use `catalog` and `name` props to get the right icon.
Also each icon comes in different `mode` such as `regular`, `thin`, `light`, `bold`, `fill` and `duotone` which you can use to alter the look and feel of the icon.

the full list of icons can be found <a href="/docs/design-system-icons--docs">here</a>.

Icons inherit color from parent element color
